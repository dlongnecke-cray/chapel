# TODO: Need to skip if CHPL_LIB_PIC != pic and we're on linux64 I
# think?  But works on Mac without CHPL_LIB_PIC set, so shouldn't just
# skip of CHPL_LIB_PIC != pic as
# test/interop/C/makefiles/dynamicLinking/ does (which works on the
# Mac, but is currently not being tested there, unfortunately).
