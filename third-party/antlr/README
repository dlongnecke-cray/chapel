Upgrading antlr versions
========================

The directory of $CHPL_HOME/third-party/antlr/ contains the source
folder for ANTLR4 as it was downloaded from the above URL. Version
updates should be done as follows:

2. `cd $CHPL_HOME/third-party/antlr && rm -rf antlr4-cpp-runtime-*`
3. `mv <download-dir> .`
4. TODO: `git add --force <download-dir>` (--force to ignore our .gitignore)
5. update the version number mentioned above
6. TODO: update the okversions whitelist in ???
7. check that the compiler builds with antlr
8. commit, PR, merge, etc
